/**
 * This program is a take on the classic bottle count down song.
 * Instead of bottles of regular milk, we have bottles of deluxe
 * Purity red cap chocolate milk.
 *
 * The Program uses a GUI for the user to input the amount of bottles
 * and how many to count down by. The song is then printed to the console.
 *
 * The Gui class is used to handle most of this program. The BottleSong
 * class is just used for its method that knows how to print the song.
